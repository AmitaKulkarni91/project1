YouTube Data harvesting

Project: Youtube Data Harvesting and warehousing using SQL and Streamlite.
Problem Statement: To create a Streamlite application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels.
Approach: Here I am using Streamlit to create a simple UI where I can enter  a YouTube channel ID and view the channel details.
I am using the YouTube API to retrieve channel and video data.
Once the data from YouTube is retrieved,migrated it to warehouse.Here I am using MySQL as a database.
Using SQL queries created the tables to retrieve data for specific channels based on user input.
Finally I can display the retrieved data from the YouTube API and display the data in Streamlit app.
